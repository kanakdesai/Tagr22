<a href="tagr.co.in">Tagr</a> is a toll payments and lending platform through which we allow users to plan their journey and recharge their FasTags accordingly. We even provide credit through our post-paid FasTags to fleet owners through which they can pay for their tolls and fuel through their FasTag without having to worry about recharging it.
